# Requirements
- Setup a React, Redux project
  - You can use any boilerplate project, e.g. create-react-app
  - You are allowed to access Internet for any legal resources

- This project is for managing equipments. It should include the following screens:
  - The equipment list page
    - User can see a list of equipment which includes ID, Model, Manufacture Date
    - User can go to the detail page by clicking an element (button, link, etc.)
    - User can go to the creation page by clicking an element (button or link)
  - The equipment detail page
    - User can see all fields of a specific equipment
    - User can modify the equipment fields (except ID). The changes should be saved to service.
    - If user refreshes page, the page should still be the detail page
  - The equipment creation page
    - User can input Model, Brand, Weight, Manufacture Date
    - No need to input ID (it will be generated by service)
    - If user clicks links to other page, there should be confirmation dialog about that user's input are not saved yet
    - After item is created, the page should be same with the detail page (including URL)
  - The equipment deletion confirm dialog
    - User can confirm or cancel the deletion operation
    - After item is deleted successfully, the page should be redirected to the list page


# Additional requests
- You must use git (local or github) to manage your code changes
- It's better to have consistent code style in your code
- It's better to show proper feedback messages to user (e.g. item saved successfully, API failures, etc.)
- It will be great if you structure your pages by `react-router-dom`, and use `redux-saga` to handle the async state changes.

# API Service
- You don't need write your own back end service (you could modify the service if necessary).
- See `README.md` in `service` folder for how to start and use the mocked API service.
